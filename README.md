# CS61A

It is an intro but pretty hard CS [course](https://cs61a.org) by UC Berkeley.

This course is designed around the book *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.

It's meant to teach python, SQL and scheme in an abstract way.

I've added solutions for:
- [Homework](hw/)
- [Labs](labs/)
- [Discussions](discussions/)
- [Projects](project/)

I've also made some [notes](notes/).
